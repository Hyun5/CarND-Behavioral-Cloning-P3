Overview
---
This repository contains the final submit for the Udacity Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, I used the deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. I traind, validated and tested a model using Keras. The model output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

Udacity have provided a simulator where I can steer a car around a track for data collection. I used image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then used this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

My project includes the following files:
* model.py containing the script to create and train the model
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network 
* video.mp4 a video recording of the vehicle driving autonomously around the track
* READ.md summarizing the results

This README file describes how to output the video in the "Details About Files In This Directory" section.


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report


### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Model architecture

My model is based on the information of the Udacity lecture and the NVIDA architecture.

```
model = Sequential()
model.add(Lambda(lambda x: x / 255.0 - 0.5, input_shape=(160,320,3)))
model.add(Cropping2D(cropping=((70,25),(0,0))))
model.add(Conv2D(24,5,5,subsample=(2,2),activation="relu"))
model.add(Conv2D(36,5,5,subsample=(2,2),activation="relu"))
model.add(Conv2D(48,5,5,subsample=(2,2),activation="relu"))
model.add(Conv2D(64,3,3,activation="relu"))
model.add(Conv2D(64,3,3,activation="relu"))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(100))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(50))
model.add(Dense(10))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam')
model.fit_generator(train_generator, steps_per_epoch=np.ceil(len(train_samples)/batch_size),
            validation_data=validation_generator,
            validation_steps=np.ceil(len(validation_samples)/batch_size),
            epochs=5, verbose=1)
```

#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model

The model contains dropout layers in order to reduce overfitting.
I added 2 times of 50% Dropout in the model.

#### 3. Model parameter tuning

The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 25).

#### 4. Appropriate training data

Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road ... 

For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. 

### Model Architecture and Training Strategy

#### 1. Solution Design Approach

The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to ...

My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the ... I thought this model might be appropriate because ...

In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had a low mean squared error on the training set but a high mean squared error on the validation set. This implied that the model was overfitting. 

To combat the overfitting, I modified the model so that ...

Then I ... 

The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track... to improve the driving behavior in these cases, I ....

At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.

#### 2. Final Model Architecture

The final model architecture (model.py lines 18-24) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes ...

Here is a visualization of the architecture (note: visualizing the architecture is optional according to the project rubric)

#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process

To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded two laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:

![alt text][image2]

I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to .... These images show what a recovery looks like starting from ... :

![alt text][image3]
![alt text][image4]
![alt text][image5]

Then I repeated this process on track two in order to get more data points.

To augment the data sat, I also flipped images and angles thinking that this would ... For example, here is an image that has then been flipped:

![alt text][image6]
![alt text][image7]

```
# Now flip the image left-to-right
flippedImg = np.fliplr(image)
images.append(flippedImg)
angles.append(-angle)
```

Etc ....

After the collection process, I had X number of data points. I then preprocessed this data by ...


I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put Y% of the data into a validation set. 

I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was Z as evidenced by ... I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.




























## Details About Files In This Directory

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the trained model as an h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`. See the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#how-can-i-save-a-keras-model) for how to create this file using the following command:
```sh
model.save(filepath)
```

Once the model has been saved, it can be used with drive.py using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

Note: There is known local system's setting issue with replacing "," with "." when using drive.py. When this happens it can make predicted steering values clipped to max/min values. If this occurs, a known fix for this is to add "export LANG=en_US.utf8" to the bashrc file.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.h5 run1
```

The fourth argument, `run1`, is the directory in which to save the images seen by the agent. If the directory already exists, it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

```

The image file name is a timestamp of when the image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Creates a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be the name of the directory followed by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally, one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

Will run the video at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.

#### Why create a video

1. It's been noted the simulator might perform differently based on the hardware. So if your model drives succesfully on your machine it might not on another machine (your reviewer). Saving a video is a solid backup in case this happens.
2. You could slightly alter the code in `drive.py` and/or `video.py` to create a video of what your model sees after the image is processed (may be helpful for debugging).

### Tips
- Please keep in mind that training images are loaded in BGR colorspace using cv2 while drive.py load images in RGB to predict the steering angles.
